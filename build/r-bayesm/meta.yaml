  summary: 'Covers many important models used in marketing and micro-econometrics applications.  The
    package includes: Bayes Regression (univariate or multivariate dep var), Bayes Seemingly
    Unrelated Regression (SUR), Binary and Ordinal Probit, Multinomial Logit (MNL) and
    Multinomial Probit (MNP), Multivariate Probit, Negative Binomial (Poisson) Regression,
    Multivariate Mixtures of Normals (including clustering), Dirichlet Process Prior
    Density Estimation with normal base, Hierarchical Linear Models with normal prior
    and covariates, Hierarchical Linear Models with a mixture of normals prior and covariates,
    Hierarchical Multinomial Logits with a mixture of normals prior and covariates,
    Hierarchical Multinomial Logits with a Dirichlet Process prior and covariates, Hierarchical
    Negative Binomial Regression Models, Bayesian analysis of choice-based conjoint
    data, Bayesian treatment of linear instrumental variables models, Analysis of Multivariate
    Ordinal survey data with scale usage heterogeneity (as in Rossi et al, JASA (01)),
    Bayesian Analysis of Aggregate Random Coefficient Logit Models as in BLP (see Jiang,
    Manchanda, Rossi 2009) For further reference, consult our book, Bayesian Statistics
