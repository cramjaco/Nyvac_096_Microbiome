Installation notes.

Phangorn and dada2 require -c condas-forge r rather than -r r, for whatever reason

Mirkat had to be built using condas skeleton. I've uploaded it to anacondas cloud and now it can just be pulled down from the cramjaco repo.

I'll need to discuss adding the condas forge channel for any installation.

Still missing the following packages.

gridExtra

phangorn - may need to be built? no, its bioconductor

DECIPHER - does appear to need to be build -- not in cran. This poses a problem, may use install.packages for this one.

imputeMissings - skeleton build?

compositions -- build from skeleton, requires r-bayesm & r-tensora
r-bayesm is in the trent channel

car

## test installing each of these
conda install -n test6 -c r r-gridextra
conda install -n test6 -c bioconductor r-phangorn
conda install -n test6 -c trent r-bayesm

conda skeleton cran tensorA
conda build r-tensora
anaconda upload ~/Programs/anaconda3/conda-bld/linux-64/

conda config --add channels cramjaco
conda config --add channels trent
conda config --add channels conda-forge # so its on top of the list

conda build r-compositions

still complaining about bayesm. building my own now.

conda upload
r-tensora
r-bayesm
r-compositions
r-imputemissings


conda install -n test6 -c cramjaco r-imputemissings r-compositions

I tried to build r-decipher from git source.

Dependencies shouldn't include things that come in base r.

Currently getting error message that it cant checkout v2.6.0.
What if I just do away with that bit in the meta.yaml file?

The compositions package, called not with library, but directly, apparently requires mclust, which allegedly installed without problem, but throws some silly error message:

library(mclust)

Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘mclust’ in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/jcram/Programs/anaconda3/envs/nyvac-lab-1/lib/R/library/mclust/libs/mclust.so':
  `maximal number of DLLs reached...
Traceback:

2. tryCatch({

 . }, error = function(e) {
 .     P <- if (!is.null(cc <- conditionCall(e))) 
 .         paste(" in", deparse(cc)[1L])
 .     else ""
 .     msg <- gettextf("package or namespace load failed for %s%s:\n %s", 
 .         sQuote(package), P, conditionMessage(e))

 . })
3. tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
4. tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
5. value[[3L]](cond)
6. stop(msg, call. = FALSE, domain = NA)

I tried
 conda install -c conda-forge r-chemometrics

Can't run R from command line apparently unless

https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues/5350

conda install -n test7 -c conda-forge readline=6.2

doesn't actually help, in my case.

Ok, fun fact. R only lets you load 100 packages. The maximal number of DLLs error means, that I just tried to load my 101st package and so everything exploaded. I've skipped some calles to library by calling the one dada2 and one phanorn function with the :: operator.
