  summary: The package provides convenience functions for advance linear algebra with tensors
    and computation with datasets of tensors on a higher level abstraction. It includes
    Einstein and Riemann summing conventions, dragging, co- and contravariate indices,
    parallel computations on sequences of tensors.
